PAFit v0.9.2 (Release date: 2017-1-20)
==============

Changes:

* Adding functions for performing cross validation when assuming Ak = k^alpha. This will reduce the cross validation to one-dimensional search, since in this case we only have to find the optimum parameter s for fitness.

* Fixing a bug in reading factor data.
